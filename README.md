# 🦸‍♂️ Superhero OOP Assignment

## 📚 Assignment Overview

This project is part of a programming assignment focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python. The task involves creating a class that models real-world entities using inheritance and polymorphism.

For this assignment, the concept of **Superheroes** is used — specifically featuring **Superman** and **Batman** — to demonstrate how classes and methods can be designed to reflect unique behaviors while sharing a common structure.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Use of constructors to initialize objects
- ✅ Implementation of inheritance between a base class and subclasses
- ✅ Application of **polymorphism** using overridden methods
- ✅ Use of a polymorphic function to call subclass-specific behavior

---

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- **Class Definition**: `Superhero` is the base class.
- **Constructor (`__init__`)**: Used to initialize each superhero with a name.
- **Inheritance**: `Superman` and `Batman` inherit from `Superhero`.
- **Polymorphism**: Each subclass defines its own version of the `power()` method.
- **Encapsulation (optional)**: The example can be extended to include private attributes and getter/setter methods.
